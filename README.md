* Built a Dashboard App, integrating Firebase Authentication for secure user registration/login with 
  an auto-login feature that routes authenticated users directly to the Dashboard.   
* I created custom widgets like buttons, text fields, and containers to keep the UI clean and reusable.
* Added firebase and Email/Password authentication.
* Implemented real-time donation tracking via FirebaseFirestore: creating a new donor entry with 
  donation amount and leaderboard placement on first contribution, and updating the record on 
  subsequent donations.
* Designed modular pages including AnnouncementPage, LeaderboardPage, and donation 
  management forms, using reusable widgets to ensure a consistent and maintainable UI.
