# dashboard_app

* This is a simple DashBoard Flutter app.
* It has a Log-In page and Sign-Up page, a dashboard showing referral code and total donations, a leaderboard, and an announcements section.
* I created custom widgets like buttons, text fields, and containers to keep the UI clean and reusable.
* Everything is static, there's no backend or authentication.
