# dashboard_app
This is a simple Flutter app I built to showcase a basic donation tracking system.
It has a sign-up page, a dashboard showing referral code and total donations, a leaderboard, and an announcements section.
I created custom widgets like buttons, text fields, and containers to keep the UI clean and reusable.
Everything is static for now – there's no backend or authentication – just focusing on the layout and design part.
